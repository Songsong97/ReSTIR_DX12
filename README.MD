## Introduction

This repository contains our implementation of Reservoir-based SpatioTemporal Importance Resampling(i.e. ReSTIR) with DirectX Raytracing. Our base code is from Chris Wyman's DXR tutorials ["A Gentle Introduction To DirectX Raytracing"](http://cwyman.org/code/dxrTutors/dxr_tutors.md.html). He is also one of the authors of our reference paper. The code is dependent on Nvidia's [Falcor](https://developer.nvidia.com/falcor) framework.
